# What is this ?
I was just playing , trying to make scrap all tech technical blogs and websites I find 

Basically , I do not do anything special , just subtracting three classes for different data source type , then each website is extending it to just define its specific markup selectors

# Will be any more changes ?
Nope , but If you find it useful and wated to make use of it, open PR and I will merge it or tell me and I will give access over the repo

#To Install ENV
pip install scrapy pymongo slugify HTMLParser rdflib tagger dateparser python-dateutil sumy

# to run spiers
scrapy crawl arstechnica

# Don't forget debugging levels 
scrapy crawl arstechnica -L INFO

# List Spiders 
scrapy list

Have fun :)
